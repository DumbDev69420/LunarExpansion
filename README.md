An **Trainer** for the Minecraft Client "Lunar Client".
 
I started this Project to learn more about Java and Java Gamehacking while still using c++ because i love c++

## Status
Not working for now, i will keep working on this and add more Functionality. 
 
My Objectives for now: Add Esp for Entities and Players, Add Simple Flyhack for Player

## Legality and Ethicality
_**I donÂ´t condone anyone to use this to Cheat on Servers**_, this is just for Educational Purposes for my Journey as becoming better in Gamehacking and reverse Engeneering in general

## How to Build
