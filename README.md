## About
An **Trainer** for the Minecraft Client "Lunar Client".
 
I started this Project to learn more about Java and Java Gamehacking while still using c++ because i love c++

## Status
Working!, for now I added: Simple Velocity Flyhack for Player.
 
My Objectives for now: Add Esp for Entities and Players.

## Legality and Ethicality
_**I donÂ´t condone anyone to use this to Cheat on Servers**_, this is just for Educational Purposes for my Journey as becoming better in Gamehacking and reverse Engeneering in general.

## How to Build 
I will add this later since i wanna make this work first
